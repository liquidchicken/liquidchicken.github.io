The AWS CLI has a rich set of features to query things like EC2 instances and
CloudFormation stack.  They @--query@ and @--filter@ options do the allow one
to construct very complex queries.

The query argument is a [JMESPath](http://jmespath.readthedocs.org/) expression.

h3. Getting started

To get a list of your EC2 instances:
<pre><code>
 $ aws ec2 describe-instances| head -10
  {
      "Reservations": [
          {
              "OwnerId": "123456789012",
              "ReservationId": "r-938f9dd9",
              "Groups": [],
              "Instances": [
                  {
                      "Monitoring": {
                          "State": "disabled"
</code></pre>
