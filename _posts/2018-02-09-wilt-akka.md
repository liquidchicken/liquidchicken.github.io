OOP does not work well in multi-threaded environments.  Common solutions like
locking lead to performance and scalability issues.

Enter [Akka](https://akka.io/), a new programming paradigm for applications
requiring execution concurrency.  Akka introduces the "Actor Model" that uses a
message passing approach (communication) rather than OOP's method call
approach.
