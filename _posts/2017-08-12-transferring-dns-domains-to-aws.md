title: Transferring DNS Domains to AWS
---
I transferred my personal domain, liquidchicken.org to AWS today with little issue.  It's important to follow Amazon's instructions very carefully.  See: [Transferring Registration for a Domain to Amazon Route 53](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-transfer-to-route-53.html)

Make sure the admin contact e-mail for the domain is up to date.
