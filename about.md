I am a recovering sysadmin.  It's not easy.  I started life writing code, but I
wandered into the Unix/Infrastructure swamp and got stuck there for eight long
years.  I have gotten rid of my
[pets](https://blog.engineyard.com/2014/pets-vs-cattle).  Now I herd
[cattle](http://www.lauradhamilton.com/servers-pets-versus-cattle).

### Now, I'm living the "Infrastructure as Code" dream.

Currently, my work focuses on deploying application development and test tools in
Amazon Web Services.
